하세요 = Do this, please.
부탁합니다 = Thank you for agree to do this favor for me.
하세요 is used to order someone to do something. It&rsquo;s literal translation is &ldquo;please do&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s a very direct way of communicating. In English it would be like saying, &ldquo;do this&hellip;please&rdquo;. &ldquo;하세요&rdquo; is something you might hear when your boss asks you to perform a task.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[음료 = drink or beverage
음료수 = tasty beverage
Not all Koreans agree that there&rsquo;s a distinction between 음료 and 음료수. Most that I&rsquo;ve spoken to claim, that the words are interchangable in most situations. But, all agreed that 음료 is a general term that refers to all kinds drinks and beverages. Things like water, beer, wine, coffee, tea, etc.
For some, 음료수 is only used to refer to a drink that quenches thurst.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[물고기 = fish (living fish)
생선 = fish (to eat)
해산물 = seafood
Both 물고기 and 생선 have the literally meaning of fish but they&rsquo;re used in different contexts.
물고기 refers to a living fish and is used to refer to a broad range of swimming animials with spines and gills. Things like sharks, tuna, goldfish, etc. But a jellyfish or a starfish.
생선 refers to fish you eat. More specially, fish that have purposely been cuaght for eating, like the salmon on your dinner plate.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I went to a Korean hair salon today to get a haircut and (attempt to) practice my korean. It went&hellip;okay. Turns out chitchatting with a stranger in Korean for 20+ minutes is really difficult. I go back in 4 weeks and I&rsquo;m determined to do better next time.
Here&rsquo;s a few words and phrases I hope to use next time. I&rsquo;ll add more in the next few days.
Basics:
미용실 = beauty salon 머리카락 = hair on your head 가위 = scissors 샴푸 = shampoo 린스 = hair conditioner Entering the Salon:]]></description>
