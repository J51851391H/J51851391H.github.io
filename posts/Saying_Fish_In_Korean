> 물고기 = fish (living fish)
> 생선 = fish (to eat) 
> 해산물 = seafood

Both 물고기 and 생선 have the literally meaning of fish but they're used in different contexts.  

물고기 refers to a living fish and is used to refer to a broad range of swimming animials with spines and gills.  Things like sharks, tuna, goldfish, etc.  But a jellyfish or a starfish.  

생선 refers to fish you eat.  More specially, fish that have purposely been cuaght for eating, like the salmon on your dinner plate.  

But be careful, becuase 생선 does not mean seafood.  It only refers to *fish* you eat, not things like clams, squip, and octopus.  If you want to refer to seafood in general, use 해산물.

The distinction is particually challenging for nonnative Korean speakers becuase "고기" usually refers to meat.  For example, 돼지고기 (pork), 닭고기 (chicken), or 소고기 (beef).  So you would think 물 (water) + 고기 (meat) would refer to the fish you eat...but it's never that simple. :)
