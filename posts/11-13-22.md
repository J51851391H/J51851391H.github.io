Yesterday I couldn't remember the word 언제 (when) for some reason, so I thought I review several question words today.

누구 = who
뭐 = what
언제 = when
어디 = where
왜 = why
어떻게 = how
무슨 = which
얼마 = how much
몇 = how many

And some sentences for 언제:

- 언제 했어요? (When did you do it?)
- 언제 왔어요? (When did you come?)
- 언제 일어나요? (When did you get up?)
- 침에 몇 시에 일어나요? (What time did you get up in the morning?)
