I went to a Korean hair salon today to get a haircut and (attempt to) practice my korean.  It went...okay.  Turns out chitchatting with a stranger in Korean for 20+ minutes is really difficult. I go back in 4 weeks and I'm determined to do better next time.

Here's a few words and phrases I hope to use next time.  I'll add more in the next few days.

**Basics:**
- 미용실 = beauty salon
- 머리카락 = hair on your head
- 가위 = scissors
- 샴푸 = shampoo
- 린스 = hair conditioner

**Entering the Salon:**
- 예약 있어요 = I have a reservation/appointment.
- 괜찮아요, 저는 기다릴 거예요 = I will wait.

**Instructions to the Stylist:**
- 이렇게 머리 하고 싶어요 = I want my hair like this (referring to a picture)
- 다듬기만 해주세요 = Please just a trim.

**Small Talk:**
- 어떻게 지내세요? = How are you?
- 날씨가 춥지요? = The weather is cold, right?

**Paying:**
- 얼마예요? = How much is it?
- 예약 해주세요 = Please make a reservation.
