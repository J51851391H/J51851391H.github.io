    <description><![CDATA[Maxims: Consistency is paramount. 30 minutes of focused study everyday including reading, writing, listening, and speaking. Learn only what you can use now. Avoid specialized/sophisticated words. Create simple routines to make studying easy. Start by building a foundation of: 10 to 20 useful phrases that can be used daily. 400 to 500 most frequent nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs. Question words. 2 or 3 sentence strucutures. Plan: Use paper flashcards. Apps and websites just lead to distraction.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[해 주세요 = Please do this for me.
하세요 = Do this, please.
부탁합니다 = Thank you for agree to do this favor for me.
하세요 is used to order someone to do something. It&rsquo;s literal translation is &ldquo;please do&rdquo; but it&rsquo;s a very direct way of communicating. In English it would be like saying, &ldquo;do this&hellip;please&rdquo;. &ldquo;하세요&rdquo; is something you might hear when your boss asks you to perform a task.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[음료 = drink or beverage
음료수 = tasty beverage
Not all Koreans agree that there&rsquo;s a distinction between 음료 and 음료수. Most that I&rsquo;ve spoken to claim, that the words are interchangable in most situations.

For some, 음료수 is only used to refer to a drink that quenches thurst.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[물고기 = fish (living fish)
생선 = fish (to eat)
해산물 = seafood
Both 물고기 and 생선 have the literally meaning of fish but they&rsquo;re used in different contexts.
물고기 refers to a living fish and is used to refer to a broad range of swimming animials with spines and gills. Things like sharks, tuna, goldfish, etc. But a jellyfish or a starfish.
생선 refers to fish you eat. More specially, fish that have purposely been cuaght for eating, like the salmon on your dinner plate.]]></description>

뭐 = what
언제 = when
어디 = where
