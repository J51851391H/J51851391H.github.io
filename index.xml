    <description><![CDATA[음료 = drink or beverage
음료수 = tasty beverage
Not all Koreans agree that there&rsquo;s a distinction between 음료 and 음료수. Most that I&rsquo;ve spoken to claim, that the words are interchangable in most situations. But, all agreed that 음료 is a general term that refers to all kinds drinks and beverages. Things like water, beer, wine, coffee, tea, etc.
For some, 음료수 is only used to refer to a drink that quenches thurst.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[물고기 = fish (living fish)
생선 = fish (to eat)
해산물 = seafood
Both 물고기 and 생선 have the literally meaning of fish but they&rsquo;re used in different contexts.
물고기 refers to a living fish and is used to refer to a broad range of swimming animials with spines and gills. Things like sharks, tuna, goldfish, etc. But a jellyfish or a starfish.
생선 refers to fish you eat. More specially, fish that have purposely been cuaght for eating, like the salmon on your dinner plate.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[Yesterday I couldn&rsquo;t remember the word 언제 (when) for some reason, so I thought I review several question words today.
누구 = who
뭐 = what
언제 = when
어디 = where
왜 = why
어떻게 = how
무슨 = which
얼마 = how much
몇 = how many
And some sentences for 언제:
언제 했어요? (When did you do it?) 언제 왔어요? (When did you come?) 언제 일어나요? (When did you get up?]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I went to a Korean hair salon today to get a haircut and (attempt to) practice my korean. It went&hellip;okay. Turns out chitchatting with a stranger in Korean for 20+ minutes is really difficult. I go back in 4 weeks and I&rsquo;m determined to do better next time.
Here&rsquo;s a few words and phrases I hope to use next time. I&rsquo;ll add more in the next few days.
Basics:
미용실 = beauty salon 머리카락 = hair on your head 가위 = scissors 샴푸 = shampoo 린스 = hair conditioner Entering the Salon:]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[I just finished Share Your Work by Austin Kleon. It&rsquo;s a great (short) book that recommends learning out loud online.
Here&rsquo;s my favorite tidbits from the book:
Get obsessed with something and spend a ton of time thinking out loud about it.
&ldquo;The best way to get started on a path&hellip;is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.&rdquo;]]></description>
