      <description>Yesterday I couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the word 언제 (when) for some reason, so I thought I review several question words today.
누구 = who
뭐 = what
언제 = when
어디 = where
왜 = why
어떻게 = how
무슨 = which
얼마 = how much
몇 = how many
And some sentences for 언제:
언제 했어요? (When did you do it?) 언제 왔어요? (When did you come?) 언제 일어나요? (When did you get up?</description>

      <description>I went to a Korean hair salon today to get a haircut and (attempt to) practice my korean. It went&amp;hellip;okay. Turns out chitchatting with a stranger in Korean for 20+ minutes is really difficult. I go back in 4 weeks and I&amp;rsquo;m determined to do better next time.
Here&amp;rsquo;s a few words and phrases I hope to use next time. I&amp;rsquo;ll add more in the next few days.
Basics:
미용실 = beauty salon 머리카락 = hair on your head 가위 = scissors 샴푸 = shampoo 린스 = hair conditioner Entering the Salon:</description>

      <description>I just finished Share Your Work by Austin Kleon. It&amp;rsquo;s a great (short) book that recommends learning out loud online.
Here&amp;rsquo;s my favorite tidbits from the book:
Get obsessed with something and spend a ton of time thinking out loud about it.
&amp;ldquo;The best way to get started on a path&amp;hellip;is to think about what you want to learn, and make a commitment to learning it in front of others.&amp;rdquo;</description>

      <description>Hi! I&amp;rsquo;m Jerry. I&amp;rsquo;m a husband and dad living in Chicago.
My wife was born and raised in Korea and my two kids are both fluent Korean speakers. I&amp;rsquo;m&amp;hellip;working on it.
The truth is, learning Korean is hard. I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled for years to reach fluency, so I started this blog to share what I know with you. Hopefully my successes, and failures, will help you on your own Korean language journey.</description>
