    <description><![CDATA[음료 = drink or beverage
음료수 = tasty beverage
Not all Koreans agree that there&rsquo;s a distinction between 음료 and 음료수. Most that I&rsquo;ve spoken to claim, that the words are interchangable in most situations.

For some, 음료수 is only used to refer to a drink that quenches thurst.]]></description>

    <description><![CDATA[물고기 = fish (living fish)
생선 = fish (to eat)
해산물 = seafood
Both 물고기 and 생선 have the literally meaning of fish but they&rsquo;re used in different contexts.
물고기 refers to a living fish and is used to refer to a broad range of swimming animials with spines and gills. Things like sharks, tuna, goldfish, etc. But a jellyfish or a starfish.
생선 refers to fish you eat. More specially, fish that have purposely been cuaght for eating, like the salmon on your dinner plate.]]></description>
